**Improved ACE Arsenal Category** adds 3 tabs to the ACE arsenal to categorize items better. This mod is a client side mod.
If [KAT - Advanced Medical REWRITE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2020940806) is loaded, it will detect if the medical tab from KAT was added or not. If yes, it will allow you to modify the existing tab. If no, it will add a new tab.

**CBA settings to customize what is categorized and where:** To change them, go to Options -> Addon Options -> Improved ACE Arsenal Category

Inputs are arrays of strings. Any item listed under the "Misc." items tab in the ACE arsenal can be inserted into the arrays.
