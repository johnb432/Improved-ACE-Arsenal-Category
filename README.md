**<h1>ACE 3.16.0 or above adds these tabs natively. Do not use this mod if you are using ACE 3.16.0 or above !</h1>**

**Improved ACE Arsenal Category** is a client side mod and adds 3 tabs to the ACE arsenal to categorize items better. This is not an official ACE mod.
If [KAT - Advanced Medical REWRITE](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2020940806) is loaded, it will detect if the medical tab from KAT was added or not. If yes, it will allow you to modify the existing tab. If no, it will add a new tab.
This mod is compatible with [ACE Pharmacy](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2558422366) too.
